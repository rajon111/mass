                        class="link-color"><b>SMS</b></span></a> marketing companies like slick text like simple texting
                like text magic and run
                your SMS marketing campaigns, Do we have another option? Yes, we have two other options the second
                option is to use an SMS API, We have SMS api’s like We have a sms api, we have bulk SMS we have masking
                sms, non masking sms, otp sms, a lot of companies which provide an SMS API to use on your own
                applications, so in this scenario you get the SMS API you buy credits and you connect your own
                application the SMS sender application, You can buy one we have some online tools and so on and by the
                way I’m building a SMS service website to send SMS marketing campaigns. You buy our bulk masking and <span class="link-color" routerLink="/non-masking-sms-in-bd"><b>non
                    masking</b></span> sms service , so don’t forget stay tuned with me on my site to get every new update so this is
                the second scenario SMS API connected to an SMS sender application to form your SMS system. what is the
                third option? it’s to use your mobile phone to send SMS marketing campaigns how? thanks this guy who
                developed. This awesome PHP application the mobile SMS gateway turn your Android device into an SMS
                gateway with this application, you can connect your Android device online with this system and then send
                campaigns from your mobile phone. I tested it and it works perfectly, so you can buy the script hoste it
                online and connect with your mobile phone, and start sending your own SMS campaigns with your mobile
                with your mobile network. By the way you can simply test this you can click on live preview- register
                account and test this system, before you do anything before you buy it. if you are interested you can

                do everything for you for free. if I find that you are interested in it. so comment below if you are
                interested in getting this software for free, anyway now this is the second scenario using this awesome
                application. that I found on Code Canyon. now here is the big question if you are following me following
                my courses my article on my website, you know I showed how to build your own SMTP mail server and how to
                send unlimited emails without paying. anything except for your server can we do the same thing when it
                comes to SMS?</p>
            <p><b>can we build our own SMS server and send unlimited SMS messages?</b></p>
            <p>the short answer unfortunately no we can’t do this simply without going into technical details and
                bothering your head the SMS message uses the GSM or the mobile network so without access to the mobile
                network. you can’t send messages to people, that’s it so simple while in email marketing and sending
                emails we are sending emails over the Internet. so everyone is connected and you can receive emails over
                this network. while in GSM or on mobile you need access to the mobile network and this is impossible
                except by using a broker or an API.</p>
